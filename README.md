## Quick Start
As of 02/2020, everything within this repository has been tested on Python 3.5+, PyTorch 1.0.0+ and TensorFlow 2.0.0

To get started it is probably easiest to just clone the repository and install dependencies with pip (or whatever package manager you desire). In this case we will use pip 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all files and dependencies have been downloaded, we can then simply just navigate to the root of the folder and run

```bash
python app.py
```

If all is successful the application should now be running in localhost, accessible by entering http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the address bar of the browser of your choice.
